# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
Dates use ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

This repository's canonical public release line is currently `0.x`.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- `codex auth switch <index>` now succeeds locally even when Codex host-state sync is unavailable.
- Removed false-negative switch failures in environments where Codex no longer exposes JSON sync files (`accounts.json` / `auth.json`).
- Clarified switch output to explicitly state local multi-auth routing remains active when host sync cannot be completed.

### Added

- CLI regression coverage for local-switch success when Codex auth sync returns unavailable/failure.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Added staged rotating backup recovery and startup cleanup for stale `*.bak(.N).rotate.*.tmp` artifacts.
- Added retry/backoff around staged backup rename commits to tolerate transient Windows locks.
- Removed invalid filesystem retry codes and constrained backup-copy retries to real Node filesystem errors.
- Hardened Windows home resolution order and `HOMEPATH` normalization to avoid drive-relative paths.
- Fixed account storage identity handling across worktree branch changes and covered realpath fallback branches.

### Changed

- Backup rotation now stages candidate snapshots before commit, preserving historical chain integrity if latest-copy fails.
- Recovery path now prioritizes WAL then backup candidates with deterministic `.bak` -> `.bak.1` -> `.bak.2` cascade.
- Storage recovery paths and rotation tests expanded for parallel ordering and failure-mode determinism.

### Added

- Regression coverage for `.bak.2` fallback when newer backups are unreadable.
- Regression coverage for transient `EPERM`/`EBUSY` retry branches in backup copy and staged rename flows.
- Startup cleanup path for orphaned rotating backup staging artifacts.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- OAuth callback host canonicalized to `127.0.0.1:1455` across auth constants and user-facing guidance (prevents localhost DNS mismatch).
- Account email dedup is now case-insensitive via `normalizeEmailKey()` (trim + lowercase).
- `codex` bin wrapper lazy-loads auth runtime so clean/global installs avoid early module-load failures.
- Per-project account storage shared across linked Git worktrees via `resolveProjectStorageIdentityRoot`.
- Legacy worktree-keyed accounts auto-migrated to canonical repo-shared storage; legacy files retained on persist failure.
- Windows filesystem safety: `removeWithRetry` with EBUSY/EPERM/ENOTEMPTY backoff added to `scripts/repo-hygiene.js` and test cleanup.
- Stream failover tests use fake timers for deterministic assertions (no real timeout flake).
- Coverage gate stabilized by excluding integration-heavy files and adding targeted branch tests.

### Changed

- CLI settings hub extracted from `lib/codex-manager.ts` into `lib/codex-manager/settings-hub.ts` (~2100 lines).
- Settings panel Q hotkey changed from save+back to cancel without save; theme live-preview restores baseline on cancel.
- Documentation architecture updated to dual-track navigation (operator and maintainer paths).
- Command, settings, storage, privacy, and troubleshooting references aligned for stronger runtime parity.
- Governance templates upgraded for production-grade issue and PR hygiene.
- `auth fix` help text now shows `--live` and `--model` flags.

### Added

- `scripts/repo-hygiene.js`: deterministic repo cleanup (`clean --mode aggressive`) and hygiene check (`check`), CI-gated.
- `lib/storage/paths.ts`: worktree identity resolution with commondir/gitdir validation, forged pointer rejection, Windows UNC support.
- Archived pre-`0.1.0` historical changelog in `docs/releases/legacy-pre-0.1-history.md`.
- `docs/development/CLI_UI_DEEPSEARCH_AUDIT.md`: settings extraction audit trail.
- PR template, modernized issue templates.
- 87 test files, 2071 tests (up from 85 files, 2002 tests).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Stable Codex-first multi-account OAuth workflow.
- Unified `codex auth ...` command family for login, switching, diagnostics, and reporting.
- Dashboard settings hub and backend reliability controls.
- Rotation and resilience modules for refresh, quota deferral, and failover.

### Validation

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
