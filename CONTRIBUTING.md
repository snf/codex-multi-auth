# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to `codex-multi-auth`.

This project prioritizes policy-compliant OAuth usage, predictable CLI behavior, strong regression coverage, and documentation parity.

---

## Scope And Compliance

All contributions must remain within this scope:

- official OAuth authentication flows only
- no token scraping, cookie extraction, or auth bypasses
- no rate-limit circumvention techniques
- no commercial multi-user resale features

If a proposal conflicts with OpenAI policy boundaries, it will be declined.

---

## Local Setup

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Node requirement: `>=18`.

---

## Development Standards

- TypeScript strict mode
- no `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error`
- behavior-focused tests for all user-visible changes
- docs updated when commands, flags, paths, defaults, or onboarding behavior change

For user-facing behavior changes, review these files at minimum:

- `README.md`
- `docs/getting-started.md`
- `docs/features.md`
- affected `docs/reference/*` files

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a focused branch from `main`.
2. Keep commits atomic and reviewable.
3. Run the full local gate:
   - `npm run typecheck`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run build`
4. Include command output evidence in the PR description.
5. Document behavior changes and migration notes when needed.
6. Ensure no secrets or local runtime data are committed.

Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` when opening the PR.
