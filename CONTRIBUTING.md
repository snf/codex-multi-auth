# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for contributing to `codex-multi-auth`.

This project prioritizes: policy-compliant OAuth usage, predictable CLI behavior, strong regression coverage, and documentation parity.

---

## Scope and Compliance

All contributions must remain within this scope:

- Official OAuth authentication flows only.
- No token scraping, cookie extraction, or auth bypasses.
- No rate-limit circumvention techniques.
- No commercial multi-user resale features.

If a proposal conflicts with OpenAI policy boundaries, it will be declined.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

Node requirement: `>=18`.

---

## Development Standards

Code quality requirements:

- TypeScript strict mode.
- No `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error`.
- Keep behavior-focused tests for all user-visible changes.
- Keep docs aligned when commands, flags, paths, or defaults change.

Documentation requirements for behavior changes:

- `README.md`
- `docs/getting-started.md`
- `docs/features.md`
- affected `docs/reference/*` files

2. Keep commits atomic and reviewable.
