## Quick Start

Install and sign in:

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
codex auth login

Override root with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR=<path>`.

---

## Configuration

Primary config root:
- `~/.codex/multi-auth/settings.json`
- or `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR/settings.json` when custom root is set

Selected runtime/environment overrides:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR` | Override settings/accounts root |
| `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_CONFIG_PATH` | Alternate config file path |
| `CODEX_MODE=0/1` | Disable/enable Codex mode |
| `CODEX_TUI_V2=0/1` | Disable/enable TUI v2 |
| `CODEX_TUI_COLOR_PROFILE=truecolor|ansi256|ansi16` | TUI color profile |
| `CODEX_TUI_GLYPHS=ascii|unicode|auto` | TUI glyph style |
| `CODEX_AUTH_BACKGROUND_RESPONSES=0/1` | Opt in/out of stateful Responses `background: true` compatibility |
| `CODEX_AUTH_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | Request timeout override |
| `CODEX_AUTH_STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | Stream stall timeout override |

Validate config after changes:

```bash
codex auth status
codex auth check
codex auth forecast --live
```

Responses background mode stays opt-in. Enable `backgroundResponses` in settings or `CODEX_AUTH_BACKGROUND_RESPONSES=1` only for callers that intentionally send `background: true`, because those requests switch from stateless `store=false` routing to stateful `store=true`. See [docs/upgrade.md](docs/upgrade.md) for rollout guidance.

---

## Experimental Settings Highlights

The Settings menu now includes an `Experimental` section for staged features:

- preview-first sync into `oc-chatgpt-multi-auth`
- named local pool backup export with filename prompt
- refresh guard toggle and interval controls moved out of Backend Controls

These flows are intentionally non-destructive by default: sync previews before apply, destination-only accounts are preserved, and backup filename collisions fail safely.

## Troubleshooting

<details open>
<summary><b>60-second recovery</b></summary>

```bash
codex auth doctor --fix
codex auth check
codex auth forecast --live
```

If still broken:

```bash
codex auth login
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Common symptoms</b></summary>

- `codex auth` unrecognized: run `where codex`, then follow `docs/troubleshooting.md` for routing fallback commands
- Switch succeeds but wrong account appears active: run `codex auth switch <index>`, then restart session
- OAuth callback on port `1455` fails: free the port and re-run `codex auth login`
- Browser launch is blocked or you are in a headless shell: re-run `codex auth login --manual` or set `CODEX_AUTH_NO_BROWSER=1`
- `missing field id_token` / `token_expired` / `refresh_token_reused`: re-login affected account

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Diagnostics pack</b></summary>
