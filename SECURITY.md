## Security Considerations

### OAuth Token Security

This plugin handles sensitive OAuth tokens. To protect your security:

✅ **What we do:**
- Store tokens in local account storage files with restricted file permissions
- Use PKCE-secured OAuth 2.0 flows
- Never transmit tokens to third parties
- Implement automatic token refresh
- Use industry-standard authentication practices

⚠️ **What you should do:**
- Never share your `~/.codex/` directory
- Do not commit OAuth tokens to version control
- Regularly review authorized apps at [ChatGPT Settings](https://chatgpt.com/settings/apps)
- Remove local plugin auth files when done on shared systems (`~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-*.json`)
- Enable debug logging (`ENABLE_PLUGIN_REQUEST_LOGGING=1`) only when troubleshooting

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT open a public issue**
2. Email the maintainer directly (check GitHub profile for contact)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours.

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Security issues are patched before public disclosure
- Reporter receives credit (unless anonymity is requested)
- Timeline for disclosure is coordinated with reporter

### Security Best Practices

When using this plugin:

- **Personal use only:** Do not use for commercial services
- **Respect rate limits:** Avoid excessive automation

### Out of Scope

- Runtime dependencies include: `@openauthjs/openauth`, `@opencode-ai/plugin`, `hono`, and `zod`
- Regular dependency updates for security patches
- No telemetry or analytics dependencies
