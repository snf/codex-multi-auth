# Troubleshooting

Recovery guide for install, login, switching, worktree storage, and stale local auth state.

---

## Start Here

```bash
codex auth doctor --fix
codex auth check
codex auth forecast --live
```

If the account pool is still not usable:

```bash
codex auth login
```

---

## Verify Install And Routing

Check which `codex` executable is running:

```bash
where codex
codex --version
codex auth status
codex multi auth status
npm ls -g codex-multi-auth
```

If an old scoped package is still active:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @ndycode/codex-multi-auth
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
```

`codex multi auth status` is a compatibility alias. The canonical command family remains `codex auth ...`.

## Browser And OAuth Problems

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser opens unexpectedly | Normal browser-first OAuth flow | Complete the auth step and return to the terminal |
| OAuth callback port `1455` is in use | Another local process owns the port | Stop the conflicting process and rerun `codex auth login` |
| `missing field id_token` | Stale or malformed auth payload | Re-login the affected account |
| `refresh_token_reused` | The token pair rotated in another context | Re-login the affected account |
| `token_expired` | The refresh token is no longer valid | Re-login the affected account |

---

## Switching And State Problems

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Switch succeeds but the wrong account stays active | Stale Codex CLI sync state | Re-run `codex auth switch <index>` and restart the session |
| All accounts look unhealthy | The entire pool is stale or damaged | Run `codex auth doctor --fix`, then add at least one fresh account |
| The dashboard shows old account state | Local files were updated outside the current session | Run `codex auth list`, then `codex auth check` |

---

## Worktrees And Project Storage

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A worktree asks for login again | The worktree still points at a legacy path key | Run `codex auth list` once in the worktree to trigger migration into repo-shared storage |
| A repo should not share accounts with another repo | Project-scoped storage is not enabled or not in use | Review the project storage rules in [reference/storage-paths.md](reference/storage-paths.md) |

---

## Diagnostics Pack

```bash
codex auth list
codex auth status
codex auth check
codex auth verify-flagged --json
codex auth forecast --live
codex auth fix --dry-run
codex auth report --live --json
codex auth doctor --json
```

---

## Soft Reset

PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item "$HOME\.codex\multi-auth\openai-codex-accounts.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$HOME\.codex\multi-auth\openai-codex-flagged-accounts.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$HOME\.codex\multi-auth\settings.json" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
codex auth login
```

Bash:

```bash
rm -f ~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-accounts.json
rm -f ~/.codex/multi-auth/openai-codex-flagged-accounts.json
rm -f ~/.codex/multi-auth/settings.json
codex auth login
```

---

## Issue Report Checklist

Attach these outputs when opening a bug report:

- `codex auth report --json`
- `codex auth doctor --json`
- `codex --version`
- `npm ls -g codex-multi-auth`
- the failing command and full terminal output
