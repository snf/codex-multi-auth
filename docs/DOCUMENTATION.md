# Documentation Architecture

Canonical governance for repository documentation quality and consistency.

---

## Documentation Layers

| Layer | Audience | Primary goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product entry | New operators | Install quickly and complete first successful login/check |
| User operations | Daily users | Configure, run, recover, and report issues safely |
| Reference | Power users and maintainers | Exact command, setting, and path lookup |
| Development | Contributors and maintainers | Internal architecture, flow, tests, and ownership |

## Canonical Policy

1. Canonical package name: `codex-multi-auth`.
2. Canonical account command family: `codex auth ...`.
3. Canonical storage root: `~/.codex/multi-auth` unless explicitly overridden.
4. Compatibility aliases (`codex multi auth`, `codex multi-auth`, `codex multiauth`) belong only in command reference, troubleshooting, or migration sections.
5. Legacy paths/flows and scoped package references belong only in migration and compatibility sections.
6. Public release line is `0.x`; historical pre-`0.1.0` entries are archived separately.

---

## Update Rules

When runtime behavior changes:

1. Update `README.md` and `docs/getting-started.md` first.
2. Update `docs/faq.md` and `docs/architecture.md` when the first-time-user story or public system framing changes.
3. Update `docs/features.md` for capability coverage changes.
4. Update relevant command/settings/path references.
5. Update `docs/troubleshooting.md` with new failure signatures or recovery steps.
6. Update development docs when architecture, config flow, or GitHub-facing metadata guidance changes.
7. Update `docs/upgrade.md` for migration-impacting behavior.
8. Update `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` when governance or safe usage guidance changes.
9. Keep issue/PR templates aligned with validation expectations.

---

## Documentation QA Checklist

Before merge:

1. Every documented command is executable as written.
2. CLI flags documented in references match runtime parser/usage output.
3. Paths match runtime modules (`lib/runtime-paths.ts`, `lib/storage.ts`, `lib/config.ts`).
4. Internal links are valid.
5. Cross-platform instructions exist for OS-sensitive operations.
6. No conflicting guidance between README, docs, and governance files.
