# Getting Started

Install `codex-multi-auth`, add an account, and confirm that `codex auth ...` is working.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `18+`
- The official `@openai/codex` CLI
- A ChatGPT plan with access to the models you want to use

---

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
```

If you previously installed the old scoped prerelease package:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @ndycode/codex-multi-auth
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
```

Verify that the wrapper is active:

```bash
codex --version
codex auth status
```

---

## First Login

```bash
codex auth login
```

Expected flow:

1. The dashboard opens in the terminal.
2. Choose `Add New Account`.
3. Complete the official OAuth flow in your browser.
4. Return to the terminal when the browser step completes.
5. Confirm the account appears in the saved account list.

Verify the new account:

```bash
codex auth list
codex auth check
```

---

## Add More Accounts

Repeat `codex auth login` for each account you want to manage.

When you are done, choose the best account for the next session:

```bash
codex auth forecast --live
```

---

## Day-1 Command Pack

```bash
codex auth status
codex auth list
codex auth switch 2
codex auth check
codex auth forecast --live
codex auth report --live --json
codex auth fix --dry-run
codex auth doctor --fix
```

---

## Project-Scoped Accounts

By default, account data lives under `~/.codex/multi-auth`.

If project-level account pools are enabled, `codex-multi-auth` stores them under:

`~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`

Linked Git worktrees share the same repo identity so you do not need separate account pools per worktree path.

---

## First-Run Problems

If `codex auth` is not recognized:

```bash
where codex
```

Then continue with [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#verify-install-and-routing).

If the OAuth callback on port `1455` fails:

- stop the process using port `1455`
- rerun `codex auth login`

If account state looks stale:

```bash
codex auth doctor --fix
codex auth check
```
