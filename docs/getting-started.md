# Getting Started

Install `codex-multi-auth`, add an account, and confirm that `codex auth ...` is working.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `18+`
- The official `@openai/codex` CLI
- A ChatGPT plan with access to the models you want to use

---

## Install

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
```

If you previously installed the old scoped prerelease package:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @ndycode/codex-multi-auth
npm i -g codex-multi-auth
```

Verify that the wrapper is active:

```bash
codex --version
codex auth status
```

---

## First Login

```bash
codex auth login
```

Expected flow:

1. If no accounts are saved yet, the terminal opens directly to the sign-in menu.
2. Choose `Open Browser (Easy)` for the normal OAuth flow.
3. Complete the official OAuth flow and return to the terminal.
4. Confirm the new account appears in the saved account list.

Verify the new account:

```bash
codex auth status
codex auth list
codex auth check
```

Choose the next account for your next session:

```bash
codex auth forecast --live
```

## Alternate Login Paths

Use these only when the normal browser-first flow is unavailable.

### Manual or no-browser login

If browser launch is blocked or you want to handle the callback manually:

```bash
codex auth login --manual
CODEX_AUTH_NO_BROWSER=1 codex auth login
```

In non-TTY/manual shells, provide the full redirect URL on stdin:

```bash
echo "http://127.0.0.1:1455/auth/callback?code=..." | codex auth login --manual
```

`codex auth login` remains browser-first by default.

### Restore a saved backup during onboarding

Backup restore appears as `Restore Saved Backup` under the `Recover saved accounts` heading in the onboarding menu.

Use it when the current pool is empty and at least one valid named backup exists under `~/.codex/multi-auth/backups` by default, or under `%CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR%\backups` if you override the storage root with `CODEX_MULTI_AUTH_DIR`.

When you choose `Restore Saved Backup`, the next menu lets you either:

- load the newest valid backup automatically
- pick a specific backup from a newest-first list

Empty, unreadable, or non-JSON backup sidecar files are skipped, so the menu entry appears only when at least one backup parses successfully and contains at least one account.

If you load a backup, the selected backup is restored, its active account is synced back into Codex CLI auth, and the login flow continues with that restored pool.

See upgrade note: [onboarding restore behavior](upgrade.md#onboarding-restore-note).

---

## Add More Accounts

Repeat `codex auth login` for each account you want to manage.

When you are done, choose the best account for the next session:

```bash
codex auth forecast --live
```

---

## Day-1 Command Pack

```bash
codex auth status
codex auth list
codex auth switch 2
codex auth check
codex auth forecast --live
```

---

## Project-Scoped Accounts

By default, account data lives under `~/.codex/multi-auth`.

If project-level account pools are enabled, `codex-multi-auth` stores them under:

`~/.codex/multi-auth/projects/<project-key>/openai-codex-accounts.json`

Linked Git worktrees share the same repo identity so you do not need separate account pools per worktree path.

---

## First-Run Problems

If `codex auth` is not recognized:

```bash
where codex
```

Then continue with [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#verify-install-and-routing).

If the OAuth callback on port `1455` fails:

- stop the process using port `1455`
- rerun `codex auth login`
- if browser launch is unavailable, rerun `codex auth login --manual`

If account state looks stale:

```bash
codex auth doctor --fix
codex auth check
```
